        In this task, you will play multiple games with other MTurk workers.  In each game, you and other players
        will answer a question and get points for your answers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will receive <strong>a base payment of $1.00</strong> for completing this task.
        Moreover, <strong>your bonus payment</strong> will be converted from
        <strong>the average of yours points in all games</strong> where 100 points = $1.00.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT use search engines or other resources to look up the answers to these questions.
        </strong>
        This would defeat the purpose of this
        research project.  Rather, we hope you treat this as a game and just <strong>have fun</strong>.
