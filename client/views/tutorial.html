        For this task, you will first be matched with other MTurk workers to play a multi-player real-time game.

        In this game, your group of MTurk workers will answer a series of factual questions.

        The game has the following rules:
        <ul>
            <li>
                During the game, you cannot communicate with the other players.
                <!--You can communicate with the other players in the game using the chatroom provided.-->
            </li>

            <li>During the game, you cannot see other players' answers.  You can only see whether another player's answer is pending, submitted or finalized.</li>
            <li>There is a time limit for each game.  Once the timer runs out, the system will automatically submit an answer for you if you haven't already done so.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<ul>-->
            <!--<li>You can communicate with the other players in the game using the chatroom provided.</li>-->
            <!--<li>During the game, you can see another player's answer as soon as he/she submits or revises it.</li>-->
        <!--</ul>-->

        Your bonus payment will be your average reward in the multiple rounds of the game.

        The closer the average is to the true answer, the higher your reward is.
